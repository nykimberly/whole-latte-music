[Sample Deployed at GitHub Pages](https://n-kimberly.github.io/JS-Project_whole-latte-music/home.html)

## Background

Whole Latte Music allows users to navigate through music libraries to play, pause, index, and seek through songs in a playlist in an intuitive and interactive way.

## Project Goals

My goal with Bloc Jams was to incorporate the five user stories designated by Bloc’s Web Developer Bootcamp curriculum. In doing so, I sought to improve my overall competency in HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery.

## User Stories Accomplished

1. Use the site on mobile
2. Play, pause, and index through songs
3. See information about my music, including album title, song title, song length, and artist name
4. Navigate through my song’s seek bar
5. Control the volume of this application
